# Tacticx.app - App Flow Document

## Introduction

Tacticx.app is a modern, web-based tactical board designed specifically for football coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts. The application enables users to create, save, and share static football tactics using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. With a sleek dark mode enhanced by vibrant Tactical Orange accents, the app combines simplicity with precision. The overall journey is designed to help users quickly sign up, design their tactical strategies on an interactive board, securely save their work, and share their tactics publicly. This document explains each page and user journey from the first interaction on the landing page to managing saved tactics and handling any errors along the way, ensuring that every step is clearly defined for developers and future maintainers.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits Tacticx.app they first encounter the landing page that introduces the service and its core value of efficient tactical creation. The landing page contains essential information about the product as well as call-to-action options to sign up or try the demo in a guest mode. Users interested in creating an account are directed to the authentication flow where multiple methods of signing up are available. Users can register using their email and password or choose an OAuth option such as Google for a quicker process. In addition to signing up, users have the opportunity to log in if they already possess an account. Should a user forget their password, a seamless recovery mechanism is provided via a dedicated reset page that guides them through re-establishing their credentials. Once authenticated, users are redirected to their personalized dashboard.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Immediately following login, users land on the dashboard that serves as the main hub for managing their tactical creations. The dashboard displays a list of saved tactics with thumbnail previews along with options to create new tactics. The navigation is clear and intuitive, featuring a top navigation bar that includes links to the user’s profile page and settings, as well as a logout option. Users can easily click on any tactic to edit or view it, and they can create new tactics through a prominent button placed consistently on the page. The arrangement is designed to provide a bird’s-eye view of all saved work while facilitating direct access to deeper sections of the application such as the tactical editor and profile management.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The tactical editor is the heartbeat of Tacticx.app where authenticated users create and modify their football tactics. Upon clicking the “New Tactic” button on the dashboard, users are taken to the editor page. Here they experience a fully interactive tactical board that supports drag-and-drop functionality for placing player icons and configuring formations. In this space, users can add drawing annotations including arrows and text, and the inclusion of undo and redo capabilities ensures that every modification is reversible. Once users are satisfied with their tactic, they can choose to manually save or rely on an autosave feature, both of which securely store data in a JSONB structure for future adaptability such as animation support. The editor page also includes options for sharing, where a unique URL is generated so others can view the tactic without needing to log in. Public viewers accessing this URL are automatically brought to the read-only viewer page that displays the complete tactic along with metadata such as the title, author, and creation date. Users can return to the dashboard or navigate to their profile from any page, maintaining a smoothly connected experience throughout the application.

The profile page gives users a public-facing venue to display their identity and share their tactical work. In addition to showcasing saved tactics, the profile page provides areas for users to update their avatar, username, and a short bio which may include coaching credentials or links to social media. This page is designed to promote personal branding and encourage networking among like-minded football professionals. The transition between the dashboard, tactical editor, and profile page is seamless, ensuring that users can focus on their tactical design and sharing experience without encountering navigational hurdles.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the application, users have dedicated areas where they manage their personal information and configurations. From the user’s profile page or a globally-accessible settings section, users can update their email, username, avatar, and even a short bio that highlights coaching credentials or social media links. Additionally, users can modify preferences such as notification settings where unobtrusive toast notifications provide feedback for various actions like saving tactics or handling errors. If subscription or billing related settings are integrated later, they will be housed in the same account management area. Once changes are made, users can easily return to the main dashboard, ensuring that account management does not disrupt their overall workflow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout all user interactions the application anticipates potential errors and provides clear, helpful feedback. If users enter incorrect information during authentication—for example, a wrong password or invalid email—the app immediately displays a friendly toast notification with actionable advice for recovery. Similarly, if a user attempts to edit a tactic they do not own, the system automatically redirects them to the viewer mode of that tactic and informs them of the access limitation. In cases where connectivity issues occur or API requests fail, loading indicators and retry options are presented so the user is not left unsure of the system’s status. These error messages are designed to be clear and discreet, ensuring that users can easily understand what went wrong and how to get back on track without interrupting the overall flow.

The journey begins on a welcoming landing page leading to the authentication flow where users can sign up using multiple methods and quickly log into a personalized dashboard. On the dashboard, users find a clean view of their saved tactics and are provided quick access to the tactical editor, where the interactive, drag-and-drop board allows for the creation and meticulous modification of football strategies.
