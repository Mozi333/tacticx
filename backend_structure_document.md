# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend of Tacticx.app plays a central role in powering the web-based tactical board for football coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts. It is responsible for managing user authentication, data storage, and secure access to tactical content. By ensuring that users can quickly create, save, and share strategies, the backend lays the foundation for a seamless and efficient user experience. The system is designed to be robust and scalable, supporting both public and private tactics with an intuitive interface and a modern, dark-themed aesthetic.

## Backend Architecture

The overall architecture of Tacticx.app’s backend is built around a modern service-oriented design. At its core, the backend leverages Supabase, a platform that integrates authentication, database management, and storage. Supabase Auth is used for both email/password and Google OAuth authentication. The architectural patterns focus on a separation of concerns, with clear delineations between user management, tactical content, and sharing functionalities.

This design supports scalability by allowing different aspects of the system—like authentication and data storage—to scale independently. Additionally, using established frameworks and patterns ensures maintainability and consistent performance as the application grows. The use of Next.js API routes for custom logic further supports a flexible and performant backend structure.

## Database Management

Tacticx.app makes use of Supabase Postgres as its primary database system. This system is highly efficient and uses JSONB for storing dynamic tactical data, which allows for flexible schema design and fast querying. The database includes a well-structured set of tables: the Users table to store data such as IDs, emails, names, profile pictures, optional bios, and social links; the Tactics table, which holds the title, pitch data in JSONB format, visibility settings, and timestamps; and the Sharing table that manages access privileges for private and public tactics.

Data is organized so that each user’s information and tactical data remain secure. Row-Level Security (RLS) is employed to enforce access controls directly within the database, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify data based on specific rules. This approach not only simplifies application logic but also enhances security and performance.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend APIs are designed to facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and the server components. Using a RESTful approach, the APIs cover key functionalities like user authentication, fetching user profiles, managing tactical data, and handling sharing operations. Endpoints are organized around core resources including user accounts, tactical boards, and shared content.

For example, authentication endpoints enable sign-up, login, and password reset processes, integrating seamlessly with Supabase Auth. Other endpoints allow for creating and updating tactics, which are stored as JSONB in the database. The design also supports public viewing endpoints where tactics can be accessed via shareable links featuring a UUID, ensuring that non-authenticated users can still view shared tactics with all necessary metadata for social sharing on platforms like OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, and LinkedIn.

## Hosting Solutions

The Tacticx.app backend is hosted on robust and reliable cloud solutions provided by Vercel. Vercel offers a flexible and efficient environment, particularly for applications built on Next.js. The integration with Supabase further enhances this setup by providing a secure hosting solution for both the database and the authentication services.

Vercel’s hosting solution is chosen for its scalability and cost-effectiveness. It also offers built-in analytics and a smooth deployment process with GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring that updates are rolled out seamlessly and with minimal downtime. This environment is ideal for handling both development needs and production-level traffic.

## Infrastructure Components

Throughout the architecture, various infrastructure components work in harmony to ensure that the application remains responsive and secure. Load balancers distribute traffic evenly across servers to prevent any single point of failure during high traffic scenarios. Caching mechanisms are implemented to speed up frequent queries and reduce latency. Additionally, a content delivery network (CDN) is used to serve static assets and multimedia content swiftly across different geographic regions.

These components are designed to work together to boost performance. Load balancing ensures efficient use of compute resources, caching decreases the load on the database by serving repeated requests quickly, and the CDN further enhances the user experience by reducing geographical delays.

## Security Measures

Security is a paramount concern in the Tacticx.app backend. Several layers of protection have been put in place, starting with secure HTTPS protocols and advanced Supabase security settings. Passwords and sensitive user data are protected using standard encryption techniques, and JWT-based authentication is leveraged to secure user sessions.

Database access is further safeguarded through Row-Level Security (RLS), ensuring that users can only interact with data they are permitted to access. Beyond basic measures, audit logging and additional encryption ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. These security practices not only protect user data but also maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend is performing optimally at all times, a set of monitoring tools and maintenance practices are in place. Vercel Analytics and Supabase logs provide detailed insights into system performance and help identify issues before they affect users. Automated monitoring, combined with GitHub Actions in the deployment pipeline, allows developers to quickly detect and resolve issues.

The approach to maintenance is proactive; regular updates and security audits are scheduled to keep the system up-to-date. This comprehensive monitoring and maintenance strategy ensures that Tacticx.app remains reliable and can scale as user demand increases.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend structure for Tacticx.app is thoughtfully designed to support the app's core functionality and future growth. By leveraging the robust features provided by Supabase and Vercel, the architecture ensures smooth user authentication, flexible and secure data storage, and efficient content delivery. The thoughtful integration of infrastructure components such as load balancers, caching mechanisms, and a CDN all contribute to a reliable, high-performance system.

By focusing on scalability, maintainability, and security, this backend setup aligns perfectly with the project’s goals of creating a modern, efficient, and intuitive tactical board for football enthusiasts. The layered security, detailed API endpoints, and integrative hosting solutions distinguish Tacticx.app from other applications, ensuring that it not only meets current user needs but is also well-prepared for future expansions.
